This was a project that I created at college in 2015 and I thought I would share it with everyone that is interested in checking it out. It is a simple Visual Basic Program that I created to do invoices for a chemical company that I made up.

USERS GUIDE Visual Basic - Invoice Project

INTRODUCTION
![2ndPage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12945384/201542884-4686d837-1317-4938-8fc7-242ff65542ef.jpg)
Welcome to my production of an invoice. This program is built for the use for a Chemcial Company to order chemicals and place orders. In this program there will be an introduction splash page, a login screen, and main invoice form were to place orders. With this program you will be able to access a web browser, a memo writer, and other functional programs built in to show other functional code that was built in Visual Basic. There will be a functional loan calculator to let customers put loans out on larger production products. This will help customers order larger quantities with ease. The web browser will be used to do research for products that customers are not sure about ordering and would like to access the main companies web pages. There will also be a memo writer to access in order to save notes that customers need to keep for later use. The other optional programs are there to show my skills in coding in Visual Basic. This program is my first program I have built in Visual Basic. This program is functional and built with the best of quality that I am able to do. The other chapters I will go through the process of how my program works, and the code that was used to implement the programs functionality.

LOGIN SCREEN
![Login Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12945384/201542909-dc143652-9e3d-415d-b82e-627c93cfc127.jpg)
Here is the login screen where the user would have to use a login name and password. With this login screen you can use the admin as the username and admin for the password, but you can always change the password with a password reset that is located in the main form after you have already logged in. There is also a back door just in case the user that owns the program can get in another way. Just in case they cannot remember their password. (++UPDATE++ The correct way the program would have really worked is that the password reset should have been in the login screen and not in the on the main form. Also, the username and password should be openly available like this but for this simple program its fine. For future programs and coding I know that this is a big security flaw and bad programming.) If the user logs in with the correct password the user will get a welcome message that will pop up. This is to show that the user has correctly inputted the right password for the program. Also, it shows an error message just in case the user types in the wrong password more than three times.

PASSWORD RESET

Here on the main form, you can reset the password so the next time you log in you can access the program. The password is saved as a sys.dll file to fool hackers to think it is an important file and would not want to mess with this type of file. (++UPDATE++ Which I know now that this is a stupid thing to do and bad programming.) It would be a way to encrypt a password from intrusion. This can be accessed through the main form under tools and reset password. There you can access the password reset form. There you input a new keyword that you want to be used of a password.

MAIN FORM

This is the main form where you would be able to input your price, quantity, product and product ID. This is also where you would be able to save you forms, product prices, and total. This program will calculate the price of the product with the amount of what you needed. You would be able to save the input and display the price and total of everything that you wanted to save. The program is able to save over 100 products before displaying the output of the price and total of everything that is being inputted into the program. There is also a progress bar at the bottom of the program that will tell you if you have saved the input properly. There is also a message box that will display any errors if input is type in wrong in the text boxes.

LOAN CALCULATER

This will make the user be able to calculate the larger invoice items and try to make it easier for the customer that wants to make payments for the items they want to pay for.

WEB BROWSER

The web browser is where the user can do research or to access the main web site to get more information about the product. This will be helpful for any user that wants to do any type of research that is needed to be done. There is also a progress bar that will let you know that the buttons are working, and that the webpage is loading properly. There is also a built-in contact button to contact the company by email.

MEMO NOTEPAD

This is the program for users to take notes and save the open Rich Text files or Text files. The program is used for just taking notes and can do almost the same thing as WordPad in Windows but with less functionality.

EXTRA FEATURES

Here I added some other feature to the program. Like About page, Disclaimer, edit tabs and short cuts, and a help feature for the program.
